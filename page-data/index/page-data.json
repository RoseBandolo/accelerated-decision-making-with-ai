In the domain of malaria for example, decades of investment in surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, and model building have resulted in an amazing suite of artifacts, and there are new contributions being made as scholarship in computational health and global development continues to be advanced.

If a model is too hard to understand, or to use, then it will not be used.
